        <h2>Flexbox Froggy</h2>
        <h5>June 18, 2019 9:03PM</h5>
        <p><b>Level 24</b> - This is most challenging level for me. It took me 12mins and 34 seconds to figure out the right rules to use to pass this level.
          <br>
 These are the flexbox rules I learned in this game: justify-content, align-items ,flex-direction, order, align-self, flex-wrap, flex-flow and align-content.</p>

<h1> Which framework do I want to learn more? </h1>

    <h1 class="blog-post-title">React.js</h1>
    <div class="blog-post-body">
      <p class="blog-post-p">
          React is a framework that was originally created, and is maintained, by Facebook. This provides a huge weight on the scales when choosing it for a project. It gives React a sense of stability that many new frameworks lack.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-post-p">
          Points to consider:
          Facebook maintains the project, the high volume of adoption and continued growth mean it will be easier to find competent React developers as well as help and outside components, the adoption of JSX allows for the structuring of components that will then compile into JS React, when running on the server, can make for more SEO friendly web pages than other JS frameworks, as the only thing seen by the client at that point is the generated HTML page(s), react Native can provide a nearly seamless mobile experience to pair alongside your React application for the web.
      <p class="blog-post-p">
          My thoughts on React.js:
          React is a great framework and a great tool. For any large, comprehensive project, it’s almost a shoe-in for usage. The biggest worry I would have as a developer adopting React is the exact same thing that makes it such a smashing success - Facebook. There have been worries about the terms of use for React, as well as Facebook’s ability to stop updates or change the licensing. This may seem too paranoid to be a show-stopper for some, but for others, it may be the reason why their project does not adopt React as their frontend framework.
          For 2019, React has higher ratings of satisfaction among developers. This helps to make React one of the most developer friendly frameworks in 2019.
