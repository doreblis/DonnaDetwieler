        Back in the Philippines, she attended Silliman University for 3 years in BS Nursing. However, due to illness, she could not complete her nursing degree. When she recovered from her illness, strict policies initiated by her school restricted her from re-enrolling for her 4th year. She decided to pursue one of her passions and was accepted in Culinary School and finished with honors. Before attending university education, she helped her parents manage their family businesses that included transportation, grocery, and, liquor distribution. When her parents moved to Canada, they left her to co-manage the boating business while attending Silliman University.

              <h2>Campaigner Personality

                ENFP-A / ENFP-T</h2>
              <p class="lead">Few personality types are as creative and charismatic as Campaigners. Known for their idealism and enthusiasm, Campaigners are good at dealing with unexpected challenges and brightening the lives of those around them. Campaignersâ€™ imagination is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.
                    <br>
                   Yet Campaigners can be easily tripped up in areas where idealism and kindness are more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, staying calm under pressure, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder or making difficult decisions, Campaigners need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.</p>
